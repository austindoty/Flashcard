# Thinkful FlashCard App


## General Overview
This app was used to understand elements of react. I utilized useState, useEffect, React-Router-Dom, and various other route specific things.
This project could be used to create, edit, update, delete (CRUD) flashcards, and it can be used to review.

### Learning Objectives
  1. Build a SAAS Platform to Study FlashCards
  2. Use React to monitor state changes, and interact with client-side rendering.
  3. Use bootstrap as the UI. This was a software project.

## What I Learned

This was my first react project. I was able to understand at a basic level the benefits of using react for responding to client side CRUD operations.
